    <h2>1. Get Started with Binance - Save on Fees Right Away!</h2>
    <p>
      When I first started trading, I didn’t realize how much those tiny fees would add up over time! Every
      trade takes a little bite out of your profits, and they add up faster than you’d think. That’s why I
      recommend <b>registering on Binance using my exclusive link</b> to get a
      <b>discount on trading fees</b>. Think of it as saving for the future – every dollar saved is a dollar
      you can reinvest. So set yourself up for efficiency right from the start. Trading is challenging enough
      without added costs – get your edge early!
    </p>
    <h2>2. The Power of Risk Management: Use the 1-2% Rule</h2>
    <p>
      Here’s the truth: one of the hardest lessons I learned was controlling my risk. When I started out, I’d
      risk way too much on a single trade, thinking “this one’s a sure thing” – and then, *bam*, big loss. Now
      I use the <b>1-2% rule</b>, which means I never risk more than 1-2% of my total trading capital on any
      one trade. So, if I’ve got $1,000, I’ll risk only $10-$20 per trade.
      <b>This isn’t just a guideline; it’s a survival tool</b>. Keeping each potential loss small means that
      even after a string of bad trades, you’re still in the game with capital to make a comeback. Trust me,
      it’s a game-changer.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Setting a Stop-Loss: Your Safety Net</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re not using stop-losses, you’re pretty much gambling. Early on, I’d hold onto a trade, thinking
      the price would “bounce back” – but then it would just keep dropping. Now, I always set a
      <b>stop-loss</b> to limit my losses. Let’s say I buy a coin at $100 and set a stop-loss at $95. If it
      hits $95, the trade closes automatically, capping my loss.
      <b>The goal here isn’t to avoid all losses but to control and minimize them</b> so you stay in the game.
      Think of it as a seatbelt – you hope you don’t need it, but when you do, it’s there to keep you safe.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Calculating Position Size: Trade Smart, Not Big</h2>
    <p>
      Position size is everything. I used to go big on trades, thinking I’d score faster profits, but all it
      did was put me at more risk. Here’s a simple formula that changed my approach:
      <b>Position Size = Risk per trade / Stop-loss distance</b>. If I’m risking $10 and my stop-loss is $2
      below the entry price, I’d buy 5 units (10/2 = 5). This keeps the size manageable so that if the market
      moves against me, I’m not losing a huge chunk of my account. Smart sizing is about being *in control*,
      even when the market isn’t.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Intraday Trading: Mastering the Day ⏰</h2>
    <p>
      If you like quick, fast-paced trades, <b>intraday trading</b> might be your thing. I tried it and
      learned a lot – it’s all about focus and quick decisions, because you’re opening and closing trades
      within the same day. For example, if I buy a coin at $50, I might aim to sell it at $53 in a few hours.
      These short trades usually target gains of 1-2%. Intraday taught me a ton about
      <b>discipline and emotional control</b>, because one impulsive move can ruin a whole day’s gains. If
      you’re down for it, this is a serious skill-builder.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Swing Trading: Patience Pays Off 🕰️</h2>
    <p>
      So, swing trading is the opposite of intraday. Instead of fast in-and-out moves, <b>swing trading</b> is
      about holding trades for days or even weeks. I like this approach for bigger price movements and less
      screen time. For instance, I might buy a coin at $50 expecting it to reach $60 over a week. I use a
      wider stop-loss here to account for fluctuations, but the reward is usually higher – I aim for gains
      around 5-10%. Swing trading requires patience, but it’s a great strategy for those who want to balance
      trading with other things in life.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Risk-Reward Ratio: Aim for 1:2 or Higher 🎯</h2>
    <p>
      This rule is non-negotiable for me. I stick to a <b>1:2 risk-reward ratio</b>, meaning for every dollar
      I risk, I aim to make at least two. If I risk $10, my target profit is $20. This is a powerful way to
      stay profitable, even if only half your trades win. By aiming for a realistic reward, you make sure that
      each win has the potential to cover a couple of losses. It’s one of the simplest ways to
      <b>keep your strategy profitable in the long run</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>8. Using Notion for Your Trading Journal 📓</h2>
    <p>
      Not keeping a trading journal is like throwing away your best lessons. Early on, I didn’t track my
      trades, and I ended up repeating the same mistakes. Now, I use <b>Notion</b> to record every trade:
      entry, exit, strategy, result, and my emotions during the trade. Reviewing this later shows me what’s
      working and what needs to change. Your journal isn’t just a record; it’s a
      <b>blueprint for improving</b>. Plus, there’s something motivating about looking back and seeing how far
      you’ve come.
    </p>
    <h2>9. Avoid Over-Trading: Quality Over Quantity</h2>
    <p>
      I used to think being constantly in the market was the way to go. I’d jump on every signal, but that
      just led to exhaustion and losses. Now, I focus on 2-3 high-quality setups and ignore the rest. It’s not
      about making a ton of trades; it’s about making the <b>right trades</b>. Over-trading can drain your
      energy and account balance. By being patient and waiting for the best setups, I stay consistent and
      stress-free.
    </p>
    <h2>10. Choosing the Right Timeframe</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing the right <b>timeframe</b> is crucial for your trading style. Intraday traders tend to use
      shorter charts (5-15 minutes), while swing traders often go for daily or 4-hour charts. When I was a
      beginner, I started with longer timeframes to get comfortable without feeling rushed. As I grew more
      confident, I tried shorter frames. The key here is to find what aligns with your lifestyle and goals, so
      you’re trading in sync with the market.
