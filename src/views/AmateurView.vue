    <h2>1. Master Risk Management: Trade Like Smart Money</h2>
    <p>
      Risk management is the foundation of successful trading. Think of it this way: Smart Money‚Äîthe big players‚Äîdon't take reckless risks. They strategically hunt liquidity and protect their positions. Why shouldn't you do the same? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here‚Äôs how I approach it:
      <ul>
        <li>Always risk a fixed percentage of your account, usually 1-2%. This keeps losses manageable even during a streak of bad trades.</li>
        <li>Place your stops where they‚Äôre least expected. Don‚Äôt set stops just below obvious support or resistance levels; add a buffer zone to avoid getting hunted.</li>
        <li>Know where liquidity pools exist. Use tools like Volume Profile to identify high-interest zones where Smart Money might strike. These areas are your entry points if you want to align yourself with market movers.</li>
      </ul>
      Think like Smart Money, and soon you‚Äôll trade like them.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Stick to One Strategy: Depth Over Breadth</h2>
    <p>
      I‚Äôve made the mistake of jumping between strategies, thinking I‚Äôd find a magic formula. The truth? Consistency comes from mastering one proven strategy. Choose one approach, test it thoroughly, and commit to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here‚Äôs a simple plan:
      <ul>
        <li>Backtest your strategy with at least 50 trades. Look at different market conditions to see how it performs.</li>
        <li>Analyze your results. Focus on refining what works instead of constantly switching methods.</li>
        <li>Stay patient. Strategies take time to prove themselves. Don‚Äôt abandon a solid plan because of a few losses.</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      Remember, depth beats breadth in trading.
    </p>
  <h2>Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution (AMD): Understanding Smart Money</h2>
  
    <h3>Accumulation</h3>
    <p>
      This is the phase where large players (institutions or Smart Money) are buying quietly while the price 
      consolidates in a range. The key here is low volatility and gradual increases in volume.
    </p>
    <h3>How to Trade It:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for signs of accumulation near a significant support zone.</li>
      <li>When the price begins to show higher lows or subtle volume spikes, it often signals that Smart Money is preparing for a move up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Manipulation</h3>
    <p>
      Also called the ‚Äústop hunt,‚Äù this phase occurs when the price dips below the range support or spikes 
      above the resistance to take out stop losses. This creates liquidity for Smart Money to enter their positions.
    </p>
    <h3>How to Trade It:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Watch for sharp moves that break key levels but then quickly reverse.</li>
      <li>Wait for confirmation of the reversal, such as a bullish engulfing candle or a break back into the range.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      After accumulating liquidity and creating a sharp move in their favor, Smart Money distributes their 
      positions as retail traders pile in. The trend either consolidates again or reverses.
    </p>
    <h3>How to Trade It:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you‚Äôre already in the move from accumulation, take partial profits when you see the price forming a new range at key resistance levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="@/assets/amd.png" alt="">
  <h2>The Dragonüê≤ Pattern: A Liquidity Sweep Setup</h2>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A downtrend followed by a first bottom.</li>
      <li>A retracement that forms a "spine" or trendline between the two lows.</li>
      <li>A second bottom that dips slightly lower than the first, grabbing liquidity (stop-losses) below support.</li>
      <li>A sharp reversal, breaking the trendline and confirming a bullish move.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Trade It:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify the first bottom and the retracement. Draw a trendline from the peak of the retracement.</li>
      <li>When the price forms the second bottom and breaks above the trendline, enter long.</li>
      <li>Place your stop-loss just below the second bottom and target the next key resistance level.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="@/assets/dragon.png" alt="">


    <h2>3. Stop-Hunting: Turn the Tables</h2>
    <p>
      Most traders fear stop-hunting, but I‚Äôve learned to use it to my advantage. Here‚Äôs the reality: stop-losses around key levels are liquidity pools, and Smart Money targets them. You can do the same by recognizing manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My process:
      <ul>
        <li>Look for a liquidity sweep at a daily high or low.</li>
        <li>Move to the 1-hour timeframe and find an area of interest, such as a Fair Value Gap or Breaker Block.</li>
        <li>Wait for manipulation in that zone and confirmation of a reversal. If it aligns, place a limit order and let the market do the rest.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="@/assets/3.1.png" alt="">
      <img src="@/assets/3.2.png" alt="">
      <img src="@/assets/3.3.png" alt="">
      Trade with the trend and capitalize on stop-hunting instead of fearing it.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Trading Hours: When Smart Money Works</h2>
    <p>
      One of the best decisions I made was limiting my trading hours. I focus exclusively on the London and New York sessions. Why? These are the times when Smart Money is most active, creating the highest liquidity and volatility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key insights:
      <ul>
        <li>Trade during the first 2 hours of each session. This is when breakouts and key moves happen.</li>
        <li>Avoid weekends. Thin markets lead to unpredictable moves and unreliable setups.</li>
        <li>Set a schedule and stick to it. Trading isn‚Äôt about being active 24/7‚Äîit‚Äôs about being active when it matters most.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="@/assets/london.png" alt="">
      <img src="@/assets/newyork.png" alt="">
      Focus on quality trading hours, and you‚Äôll see a significant difference in results.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Quality Over Quantity: Only Trade A++ Setups</h2>
    <p>
      Most traders fail because they trade everything they see. I used to be one of them. Now, I only trade A++ setups that meet strict criteria. If a setup doesn‚Äôt align with your plan, don‚Äôt trade it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My checklist for an A++ setup:
      <ul>
        <li>Is there a liquidity sweep? If not, skip.</li>
        <li>Does it align with a significant area of interest (FVG, breaker block, etc.)?</li>
        <li>Do I see manipulation in the zone? If not, move on.</li>
        <li>Does the manipulation take place on older timeframes? Older TF = bigger moves</li>
        <li>Are we in Discount/Premium zones(Optimal trade entry points)?</li>
      </ul>
      Trading fewer but higher-quality setups has transformed my results. Remember, one great trade is better than ten mediocre ones.
    </p>
    <img src="@/assets/premium.png" alt="">

    <h2>6. Higher Timeframes always more important</h2>
    <p>
      Beginners often focus on lower timeframes, thinking they‚Äôll find more opportunities. In reality, higher timeframes provide clarity and direction. A weekly chart can tell you where the market is headed, while a 1-minute chart just adds noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach:
      <ul>
        <li>Start with the weekly chart to identify the primary trend.</li>
        <li>Use the daily chart to refine your analysis.</li>
        <li>Drop to the 4-hour or 1-hour timeframe for entries, but don‚Äôt go lower than necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="@/assets/1wOP.png" alt="">
      <img src="@/assets/1dOP.png" alt="">
      <img src="@/assets/4hOP.png" alt="">
      The bigger the timeframe, the more reliable the information. Don‚Äôt trade against the larger trend.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Keep a Trading Journal: Your Key to Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      A trading journal isn‚Äôt optional‚Äîit‚Äôs essential. Without one, you‚Äôre flying blind. I use my journal to track every trade, analyze mistakes, and refine my strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here‚Äôs how I do it:
      <ul>
        <li>Record every trade: entry, exit, risk, stop-loss, and result.</li>
        <li>Take a screenshot of the setup before entering. Write why you‚Äôre taking the trade.</li>
        <li>Review weekly: identify patterns, mistakes, and winning setups.</li>
        <li>Track your emotions: Were you confident or influenced by fear or greed?</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="@/assets/prop1.png" alt="">
      <img src="@/assets/prop2.png" alt="">
      <img src="@/assets/prop3.png" alt="">
      Reviewing your journal will highlight what works and what doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs your roadmap to consistent improvement.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Manage Expectations: 60% Win Rate Is Enough</h2>
    <p>
      Many traders think they need to win every trade. The truth is, even a 60% win rate is enough to be highly profitable if you manage your risk-reward ratio correctly. For every 10 trades, winning 6 with a 1:2 ratio keeps you ahead.
    </p>
        <img src="@/assets/tableRR.png" alt="">    
    <p>
      Focus on probabilities, not perfection. Trading is a numbers game, and consistency beats short-term wins.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Don‚Äôt Watch Your Trades</h2>
    <p>
      Sitting and watching your trades unfold is a recipe for emotional decisions. Once your trade is live, trust your plan and walk away. Let the market do its job while you focus on other things.
    </p>
    <img src="@/assets/stayaway.png" alt="">
    <p>
      This approach reduces stress, prevents micromanagement, and helps you stick to your strategy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Patience </h2>
    <p>
      The market will always be there. Rushing into trades or chasing setups only leads to losses. Develop patience, wait for the market to align with your plan, and only act when the conditions are ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successful trading isn‚Äôt about activity‚Äîit‚Äôs about execution. Wait for the perfect moment, and strike with confidence. I remind you - do not use a market order, only limit orders for best prices.
    </p>
    <h2>11. Use Neutral Colors for Your Charts and Hide Your PnL</h2>
<p>
  The colors you use for your charts can have a surprising impact on your psychology. Bright reds and greens might seem natural for indicating losses and gains, but they can also trigger emotional responses, leading to impulsive decisions. Neutral colors, like shades of gray, blue, or muted tones, keep your mind focused on the analysis rather than emotional reactions.
</p>
<p>
  Here's why this matters:
  <ul>
    <li>Red and green are strongly tied to emotions like fear and greed. Seeing a "sea of red" might make you close trades too early, while a streak of green might tempt you to chase profits.</li>
    <li>Neutral colors encourage objective thinking. When your charts are less emotionally charged, you‚Äôre more likely to evaluate setups based on logic and strategy.</li>
    <li>Hiding your PnL takes this concept further. Many trading terminals allow you to hide real-time profit and loss figures. This helps you focus on the quality of your trades rather than being influenced by money.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="@/assets/colors.png" alt="">
  Trade the idea, not the money. The market doesn‚Äôt care about your emotions, and neither should you. Stick to your plan, execute your strategy, and let the results take care of themselves.
</p>
<h2>12. If You Think You‚Äôre Ready, Why Aren‚Äôt You Funded Yet?</h2>
<p>
  Let‚Äôs get real for a moment. If you‚Äôve been nodding your head, thinking you already know all this, but you‚Äôre still trading with your own limited capital‚Äîwhat are you waiting for? Getting funded is the next step to leveling up your trading game. Imagine having access to $50,000, $100,000, or more, without risking your own hard-earned money. 
</p>
